## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Industrial Engineering student at UFSCar** specializing in data analytics and business intelligence.

My professional journey includes experience in **project management**, **social impact initiatives**, and **UX/UI design** before discovering my focus in data-driven decision making. Currently, I leverage **SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI** to transform complex datasets into actionable business insights.

Today, I work as a **Data & CX Intern** at [ValeMobi](https://www.valemobi.com.br/) (fintech), where:
- 📊 Automated dashboards with Power BI
- 🔍 Identified churn patterns that became **product improvements**
- :pencil2: Made decisions based on statistical results
- 🐍 Created Python scripts that freed the team for strategic analysis
- 📈 Built data quality processes from scratch

## 🎓 Learnings That Shaped Me

### 💼 ValeMobi | Data & CX Intern
**Mar 2025 - Present**

> *"Data only creates value when it becomes a decision."*

This is where I fell in love with data analytics. Working with real clients, I learned that **speed matters less than accuracy**, and **insights mean nothing without action**.

**Key learnings:**
- **SQL became my primary language:** Started writing basic queries, now I optimize complex JOINs and CTEs for performance on PostgreSQL databases with millions of rows
- **Stakeholder communication:** Discovered that a well-designed Power BI dashboard tells a story better than a 50-slide presentation — learned to translate technical findings into business language
- **Data quality obsession:** Built documentation and validation processes from scratch, understanding that clean data is the foundation of reliable insights
- **Product thinking:** Identified churn patterns that became actual product improvements — learned that analytics isn't just about reporting the past, it's about shaping the future
- **Technical evolution:** From basic Excel formulas to building automated data pipelines with complex dashboards and codes.

### 🎨 CATI Jr (Computer Science Junior Enterprise) | Marketing & Web Design
**Mar 2024 - Jun 2024**

> *"Design principles taught me that data visualization is storytelling."*

Before diving deep into data, I explored the creative side of tech. Working with UI/UX design and web projects taught me skills I didn't know would be essential for data analytics.

**Key learnings:**
- **Visual communication:** Figma wireframes taught me hierarchy, color theory, and user flow — principles I now apply to every dashboard I build
- **Attention to detail:** Pixel-perfect designs made me obsessive about alignment, spacing, and visual consistency — habits that carried over to clean code and organized queries
- **Client-facing projects:** Learned to translate business needs into technical solutions under tight deadlines
- **Cross-functional collaboration:** Coordinated with developers to ensure designs were feasible — early lesson in bridging technical and non-technical teams

### 🤖 Red Dragons (Educational Robotics Group) | Teaching Experience
**Jan 2024 - Jun 2024**

> *"Teaching robotics to underprivileged kids showed me technology's real power: democratizing access."*

Participated in a multidisciplinary team bringing **robotics education to 100+ children in public schools** across São Carlos' underprivileged areas. This wasn't just about tech — it was about impact.

**Key learnings:**
- **Breaking down complexity:** Explaining sensors and programming logic to elementary and middle schoolers forced me to master simplification — a skill I use daily when presenting data insights to non-technical stakeholders
- **Process documentation:** Created teaching methodologies from scratch, documented workflows, and established feedback loops for continuous improvement
- **Team coordination:** Worked three distinct areas (teaching, maintenance, research) with different methodologies
- **Public speaking:** Presented at robotics fairs (OBR) and community events, developing confidence in communicating technical concepts
-**Social impact lesson:** Saw firsthand how access to technology changes lives in communities often overlooked by innovation — still drives my interest in projects with social purpose.

## 🔄 The Common Thread

These three experiences taught me different lessons, but they share a core principle:

**Technology is a tool. Impact comes from understanding people, problems, and processes — then using the right tool to create change.**

Whether it's SQL queries optimizing business decisions, dashboards clarifying complex metrics, or robotics classes opening doors for kids, the goal remains the same: **turn complexity into clarity, and clarity into action.**
